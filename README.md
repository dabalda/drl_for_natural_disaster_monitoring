# DRL for Natural Disaster Monitoring

This repository contains the codebase for the [paper] "Decentralized Multi-Agent deep reinforcement learning in swarms of drones for flood monitoring" and the
[Master's Thesis] "Analysis and implementation of multiagent deep reinforcement learning algorithms for natural disaster monitoring with swarms of drones" for the Master in Telecommunication Engineering (Universidad Politécnica de Madrid).

It is based on [Tensorflow] 1.9, [Stable Baselines], [Landlab], [deep_rl_for_swarms], [numpy] and [dandrino/terrain-erosion-3-ways].
